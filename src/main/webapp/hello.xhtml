        <p>Itâ€™s basically just a XHTML file which is by JSF
            interpreted as a Facelets file or just Facelet. This Facelets file will ultimately generate the
            HTML markup that is sent to the browser in response to a request. With help of EL, it can
            reference a bean property and invoke a bean action</p>
        <h:form>
            <h:outputLabel for="input" value="Input" />
            <h:inputText id="input" value="#{helloWorld.input}" />
            <h:commandButton value="Submit"
                             action="#{helloWorld.submit}">
                <!--The execute attribute indicates that
                the entire <h:form> must be processed on submit and the render
                attribute indicates that the tag identified by id="output" must be
                updated on complete of the Ajax submit.-->
                <l:ajax execute="@form" render=":output" />
